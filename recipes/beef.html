    <h2>Beef Stew Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        Beef stew is a hearty, comforting dish perfect for a cozy meal. It’s packed with tender beef, vegetables, and a flavorful broth</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs (900 g) beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth (or 1 quart)</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine (optional; you can substitute with extra beef broth)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen peas (or fresh if in season)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)/li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <h2>Brown the Beef:</h2>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the beef cubes in batches (don’t overcrowd the pot) and brown them on all sides. This should take about 5-7 minutes per batch. Remove the beef and set aside.</li>

        <h2>Cook the Aromatics:</h2>
        <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.</li>

        <h2>Deglaze the Pot:</h2>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using red wine, pour it in now, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Allow it to simmer for a few minutes until slightly reduced.</li>

        <h2>Build the Stew:</h2>
        <li>Return the browned beef to the pot. Sprinkle the flour over the beef and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, dried thyme, and bay leaves. Stir to combine.</li>

        <h2>Simmer:</h2>
        <li>Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for about 1.5 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>

        <h2>Add Vegetables:</h2>
        <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. Continue to simmer, covered, for another 30-40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</li>


        <h2>Finish the Stew:</h2>
        <li>Stir in the frozen peas (or fresh peas if using). Cook for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

        <h2>Garnish and Serve:</h2>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve hot with crusty bread or over a bed of rice.</li>
    </ol>
